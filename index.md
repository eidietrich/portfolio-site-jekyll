### Seasoned journalist
I've spent years in professional newsrooms, learning the craft of public service journalism a story at a time. I've covered public meetings, political campaigns and court proceedings -- routine governance, community triumphs and the occasional tragedy.

When news breaks, I pick up the phone and make calls. When a story hits a nerve with readers, I take them. By listening on both counts, I've begun to understand the world and its people.

### Part-time programmer

A self-taught developer and designer, I'm increasingly able to apply data analysis and visualization to my journalism, using code as a tool to complement my reporting and storytelling -- sometimes, even, on deadline.

I routinely comb through public databases, federal statistics and GIS datasets to explore issues and generate story ideas. When confronted with complex topics like land use and public finance, I often turn to visual elements like maps, charts and interactive graphics.

### Onetime engineer

With a degree in civil engineering, I'm an infrastructure geek by inclination and solutions-minded by training. Working in international development and public health as a student taught me the import of basic services like drinking water. I've also learned by experience that physical infrastructure relies on human institutions -- the legal, financial and political systems that, when functioning well, provide a foundation for building prosperity.

As a journalist, I'm most interested in that civic infrastructure — how it works, who it works for and what can be done to help it work better. While those topics rarely produce easy headlines, I'm learning the art of making important truths compelling -- using multimedia, narrative and analytic insight to to tell stories to help my readers grapple with hard things.
