### Full-time journalist
I've spent years working in professional newsrooms, learning the craft of public service journalism one deadline at a time. I've covered public meetings, political campaigns and court proceedings, routine governance, community triumphs and the occasional tragedy.

When news breaks, I pick up the phone and make calls. When one of my stories hits a nerve, I take them. By listening on both counts, I've begun to understand the world and its people. 

### Part-time programmer

A self-taught developer, I'm increasingly able to apply data analysis and visualization to my journalism, using code as a tool to complement my reporting and storytelling - sometimes, even, on deadline.

I routinely comb through public databases, federal statistics and GIS datasets to explore issues and generate story ideas. When confronted with complex topics like land use and public finance, I often turn to visual elements like maps, charts and interactives. 

### Onetime engineer

With a degree in civil engineering, I'm an infrastructure geek by inclination and solutions-minded by training. Working with domestic and international projects as a student, I learned the import of basic services like drinking water. I was also taught how physical infrastructure relies on human institutions - the legal, financial and political systems that provide a foundation for building prosperity.

As a journalist, I'm most interested in that civic infrastructure — how it works, who it works for and what can be done to help it work better. While those topics rarely produce easy headlines, I'm learning how to use multimedia, narrative storytelling and audience analytics to make dry-but-important topics into compelling reads — weaving together anecdote and analysis to help my readers grapple with hard, complex things.
