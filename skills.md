## Technical abilities

### JavaScript for data visualization + web development

I've worked with JavaScript and its ecosystem consistently since 2014 and am comfortable using it manipulate data and produce visualizations in hobby and professional settings. I also develop React-based web apps and have built simple backend API servers.

Familiar tools:
- **[D3](https://d3js.org/){:target="_blank"}** to produce charts and maps for print and web.
    -  [A decade of growth in the Gallatin Valley](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/a-decade-of-growth-in-the-gallatin-valley/html_b3d169bc-bb7a-596c-ae05-a8fea2de0aee.html){:target="_blank"} - Map and diagram projecting scope of potential land development.
    -  [Gallatin Valley migration by age](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/gallatin-county-migration-by-age/image_abc65da9-3f7d-50c4-be26-80c25dd7c7d3.html){:target="_blank"} - Age pyramid-style diagram for visualizing U.S. Census county-level migration data.
- **Mapping libraries** including [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-mapbox-gl/){:target="_blank"} for mapping-based web applications.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/){:target="_blank"}** for web interactive development.
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/){:target="_blank"}** for back-end data management and API server development.
- **Build tools** including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/){:target="_blank"}.

### Python for data wrangling

I've used Python as a go-to tool for data cleaning and analysis since 2014. I'm proficient with Pandas/Numpy and have also used the language in concert with geospatial analysis libraries like Geopandas and GDAL/OGR.

Familiar tools:
- **[Pandas/Numpy/SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}** - Used with iPython Notebooks for data cleaning and analysis. An example [here](https://github.com/eidietrich/gc-property-value-analysis){:target="_blank"}, detailing the code behind a county-level property analysis identifying [major local landowners](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/economy/who-owns-gallatin-county-the-bozeman-area-s-biggest-property/article_ac36b5ec-1e9c-5f87-b101-aa8cafc2adc4.html){:target="_blank"}.

### QGIS + PostGIS for geospatial analysis

I routinely use [QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/){:target="_blank"} for viewing and manipulating geospatial data, including the production of static maps for print and web. I occasionally connect QGIS to [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.net/){:target="_blank"} databases for spatial analysis projects.

### Adobe Creative Suite for graphic design

Proficient with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign, including vector data graphics with SVG Crowbar- and ai2html-based workflows. Extensive experience with web and print design. Some experience with After Effects for animated video production.
