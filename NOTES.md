## Build/deployment process

Having trouble with the automagic Github Pages deployment for some reason, so I'm using a manual workaround:
- Use `jekyll build` to build site changes to `_site` folder
- Copy contents of `_site` folder to eidietrich.github.io repository
- `git push` from local eidietrich.github.io to remote repo to update site


## TODO:
- Add LinkedIn icon and link to footer - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eidietrich)
- Tweak formatting 
- Fine-tune site description formatting
- Figure out how to automate a deploy command (build a bash script)
- Optimize hero image (mobile v desktop versions?)
- Try to clean up CSS (can I remove Bootstrap?)
- Add photography/videography to skils section
- Add Jekyll to skills section (or web development)
- Refine clips: Remove city budget story? Add Data piece on bars.
- Try replacing 2x2 button grid with a list
- Improve favicon
- Add Email icon to footer
- Clips page: Look at highlighting different sections
- Skills page: Lengthy headers --> Short headers and subheaders

- Pass by Brent

Q's for Audrey
- What do you mean by "current page differentiation"? Highlighting the currently selected page?
- Discussion on highlighting different sections on clips page
- **Post site to Github
